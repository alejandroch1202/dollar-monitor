# Monitor Dolar

Simple webpage to check the official ([BCV](https://www.bcv.org.ve/)) and the "unofficial" ([Monitor](https://monitordolarvenezuela.com/)) USD/VES rate. Now it can be installed as a PWA app.

- Minimalistic approach
- No ADS
- App made for practice and educational purposes
- PWA support

## Build and deploy command

```
cd js && echo -e "const CORSSH_API_KEY = 'YOUR_CORSSH_API_KEY';\n\nexport {  CORSSH_API_KEY };" > config.js
```
